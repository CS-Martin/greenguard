            "disease_description": "Potassium deficiency occurs when plants do not receive an adequate supply of potassium. It can affect a wide range of plants, including fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants.",
            "treatment": "To treat potassium deficiency in plants, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Soil testing: Conduct a soil test to determine the potassium levels in the soil. This will help determine the severity of the deficiency.\n\n2. Fertilization: Apply a potassium-rich fertilizer to the soil. This can be in the form of potassium sulfate, potassium nitrate, or other potassium-based fertilizers. Follow the recommended application rates.\n\n3. Foliar spray: In severe cases, a foliar spray of potassium can be applied directly to the leaves. This allows for quick absorption and can provide immediate relief.\n\n4. Organic matter: Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or well-rotted manure, into the soil. This can help improve potassium availability.\n\n5. pH adjustment: Ensure that the soil pH is within the optimal range for potassium uptake. Adjust the pH if necessary.\n\n6. Water management: Proper watering practices can help improve potassium uptake. Avoid overwatering or underwatering, as both can affect nutrient availability.\n\nIt is important to note that prevention is key in managing potassium deficiency. Regular soil testing, balanced fertilization, and maintaining optimal growing conditions can help prevent deficiencies from occurring."

However, there are some preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of occurrence. These include: \n\n1. Providing consistent and adequate irrigation to avoid water stress.\n2. Avoiding excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers.\n3. Maintaining proper soil moisture levels.\n4. Avoiding excessive temperature fluctuations.\n5. Planting disease-resistant potato varieties.\n\nIt is important to note that Hollow Heart is primarily a physiological disorder and not caused by pathogens. Therefore, it cannot be controlled with fungicides or other chemical treatments."

It is characterized by small, circular to irregular-shaped spots on the leaves. The spots start as yellow or light brown and gradually turn reddish-brown or dark brown. As the disease progresses, the spots may coalesce and cause defoliation.",
            "treatment": "To manage red leaf spot in tea plants, the following treatments are recommended:\n\n1. Prune and remove infected leaves and branches to reduce the spread of the disease.\n2. Improve air circulation around the plants by spacing them adequately and avoiding overcrowding.\n3. Avoid overhead irrigation and water the plants at the base to prevent the leaves from getting wet.\n4. Apply a fungicide specifically labeled for tea plants according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n5. Maintain proper plant nutrition and ensure the tea plants are well-fertilized.\n6. Regularly monitor the plants for any signs of disease and take prompt action if new infections occur."

The disease primarily affects the stems, leaves, and fruits of the plant. It causes dark, sunken lesions on the stems and leaves, which can eventually lead to wilting and death of the plant. Infected fruits may also develop lesions and become discolored.",
            "treatment": "To manage tomato canker, it is important to practice good sanitation in the garden. Remove and destroy any infected plant material, including leaves, stems, and fruits. Avoid overhead watering, as it can promote the spread of the disease. Fungicides can be used to control the disease, but they should be applied preventively and according to the instructions on the product label. Additionally, planting disease-resistant tomato varieties can help reduce the risk of infection."
